**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**

The Gaming Room client are a mobile gaming company that had success with a puzzle game using the Android operating system. They decided that they wanted to
create a web-based version of there popular Android game so that it would be cross platform.
	
**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**

I think that I wrote a great recommendation outlinging areas for the client to consider taking, like how to host the platform on multiple operating systems, how much memory and storage that they were going to have to consider on the host servers, secuirity, API, and how they could use serverless architecture to launch there product to end users. I think I made it clear that cloud platform would be the best way to go for there end goal as it can be cheaper and faster to setup servers in the cloud than actual on premis equipment.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**

Using the domain model and looking at it in a UML class diagram was easy for me to understand exactly what structure the application needed to take, it helped me understand the different relationships in the application and also helped me understand what classes that where going to need to be developed in order to make the application transition work.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

I think the recommendation section could have been revised to be bettere worded and more content added to help the client be even more informed. I don't think I did a good job of coming up with the right things to say for certain items and I wish I would be able to go back and revise that section to make it the best possible information that I could.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

By understanding that a user isn't going to want a slow and unsuable website those were the key things to consider going into this. Knowing that the Android app was popular and worked very well, we wanted to take that information and transfer it to the web, if the application was nothing like that than end users wouldn't want to use it. It is so important to think of the end user when developing an application because at the end of the day they are the ones that are going to be using it more than anyone else, so you want to make it work the best it can for them so they keep coming back.

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**
Starting with small ideas is how I approach designing software, starting small allows you to get a better understanding of what you are developing and then as you develop those coming up with more ideas along the way and implementing them allows for a great product.
